# Detailed Project Checklist - Relationship Resolver

**Project Goal:** To build a web application for structured conflict resolution, adhering to TDD, SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles throughout the development process.

**Mandatory Principles:**

*   **TDD (Test-Driven Development):** Write tests before writing code. Every feature and function must have corresponding unit and integration tests.
*   **SOLID (Object-Oriented Design Principles):**
    *   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each module/component should have one specific responsibility.
    *   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  Modules should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    *   **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness.
    *   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    *   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Design and implement solutions in the simplest way possible. Avoid over-engineering.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**  Avoid redundant code. Extract common logic into reusable components or functions.

**Quality Gate:** Before proceeding to the next stage, ensure all checklist items for the current stage are marked as complete and adhere to the mandatory principles. Code review is required after each stage to validate compliance.
