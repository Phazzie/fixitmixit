# FixItMixit - Relationship Resolver

A structured web application facilitating direct, effective conflict resolution between individuals by enforcing mutual understanding, accountable communication, and focused argumentation, aided by targeted AI pattern detection.

## Overview

FixItMixit provides a structured process for conflict resolution through several key phases:

1. **Issue Agreement**: Establish a single, clearly worded issue statement agreed upon by both users.
2. **Steel-Manning**: Ensure each user can accurately articulate the other's perspective.
3. **Statement Locking**: Establish each user's primary viewpoint as immutable ground truth for the discussion.
4. **Discussion**: Facilitate point-by-point exploration of perspectives via structured arguments.
5. **Resolution**: Reach a mutually agreed-upon resolution statement.
6. **Summary and Export**: Provide a consolidated record of the session.
7. **Perspective Update**: Allow optional, non-debated reflection on perspective shifts.
8. **Session Closure**: Formally end the session and gather feedback.
